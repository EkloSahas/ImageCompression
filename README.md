# Image Compression

Image compression is an application of data compression that encodes the original image with few bits. The objective of image compression is to reduce the redundancy of the image and to store or transmit data in an efficient form.

At its core, image compression is when you remove or group together certain parts of an image file in order to reduce its size. Why do that? Here are a few reasons.
  >For website optimization. Sites with uncompressed images can take longer to load, and can cause your visitors to bounce because of this.
  >For sending and uploading images. Uploading an uncompressed image can take a while, and some email servers have a file size limit.
  >For reducing the storage impact on your hard drive.
